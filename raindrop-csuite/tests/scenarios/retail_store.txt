Store Manager Log - Oct 15th

Traffic was slow this morning. We ran out of milk by 10 AM which killed our latte sales. 
Customer complaints about the AC being broken. 
The new "Spicy Muffin" is not selling at all, we threw away 20 of them.
Staff morale is low because of the scheduling mix-up.
Revenue looks okay but we need to fix the inventory issues.
